## About  
I am a Software Engineer with **8+ years of experience** and a **Master's degree in Mathematics**. Iâ€™ve worked in **startups**, reporting directly to CTOs and CEOs, as well as in **medium to large companies**, collaborating in **teams of 2 to 15 people**. My expertise is in native development (**C++**, **Rust**), algorithm-intensive tasks, and performance optimization in high-load environments, both on the server side and at the edge. I have experience across backend systems, image processing, desktop and mobile applications, data engineering, trading systems, navigation systems, and smart contracts.

I have a strong interest in mathematics (including olympiads), cryptography, algorithms, and competitive programming. I competed in math, physics, and astronomy olympiads during school and hold a diploma from the Belarusian Republican Olympiad.
